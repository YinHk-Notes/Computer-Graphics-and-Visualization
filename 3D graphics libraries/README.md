## 3D graphics libraries

3D graphics have become so popular, particularly in video games, that specialized APIs have been created to ease the processes in all stages of computer graphics generation. These APIs have also proved vital to computer graphics hardware manufacturers, as they provide a way for programmers to access the hardware in an abstract way, while still taking advantage of the special hardware of any specific graphics card.

The first 3D graphics framework was probably **Core**, published by the ACM in 1977.

### List of 3D graphics libraries


#### Low-level 3D API
- **OpenGL**
- **DirectX**
- **Vulkan**

#### Web-based API
- **WebGL**
  a JavaScript interface for OpenGL-ES-2.x API, this enables web applications to use native graphics.
  
#### High-level 3D API
- Java 3D
- Java FX
- OGRE3D
- OpenSceneGraph
- BGFX
- Magnum
- VulkanSceneGraph
- OpenSG



#### JavaScript-based engines
There is more interest in web browser based high-level API for 3D graphics engines. Some are:

- A-Frame
- Blend4Web
- CopperLicht
- O3D
- StormEngineC
- Three.js
- Babylon.js
- Verge3D
- X3DOM
