## Normal Mapping
**Normal maps** are a type of **Bump Map**. They are a special kind of texture that allow you to add surface detail such as **bumps**, **grooves**, and **scratches** to a model which **catch the light** as if they are represented by real geometry.

In 3D computer graphics, **normal mapping**, or Dot3 bump mapping, is a texture mapping technique used for faking the lighting of bumps and dents – an implementation of bump mapping. It is used to add details without using more polygons. A common use of this technique is to greatly enhance the appearance and details of a low polygon model by generating a normal map from a high polygon model or height map.

**Normal maps** are commonly stored as regular RGB images where the RGB components correspond to the X, Y, and Z coordinates, respectively, of the surface normal.
