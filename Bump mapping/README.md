## Bump mapping

**Bump mapping** is a texture mapping technique in computer graphics for simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object.

Bump maps create the illusion of depth and texture on the surface of a 3D model using computer graphics. Textures are artificially created on the surface of objects using grayscale and simple lighting tricks, rather than having to manually create individual bumps and cracks.
