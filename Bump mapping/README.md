## Bump mapping

**Bump mapping** is a texture mapping technique in computer graphics for simulating **bumps and wrinkles** on the surface of an object.

Bump maps create the illusion of depth and texture on the surface of a 3D model using computer graphics. Textures are artificially created on the surface of objects using grayscale and simple lighting tricks, rather than having to manually create individual bumps and cracks.

> The first thing you should understand about bump maps is that the detail they create is fake. No additional resolution is added to the model as a result of a bump map. Typically,

These values in a bump map are used to tell the 3D software basically two things. Up or down.


> Bump maps are really great for creating tiny details on a model. For example pores or wrinkles on skin. They are also relatively easy to create and edit in a 2D application like Photoshop considering you are just using grayscale values.


> The problem with bump maps is that they break pretty easily if the camera views them from the wrong angle. Since the detail they create is fake and not real resolution being added, the silhouette of the geometry that the bump map is applied to will always be unaffected by the map.
