Fresnel 效果可讓受影響的物件在其邊緣周圍以彩色光亮顯示


Fresnel Effect (pronounced "fre-nel," the "s" is silent) - the observation that the amount of reflectance you see on a surface depends on the viewing angle. 


Fresnel Shaders in general allow reflection, specularity, and other attributes to vary according to the viewing angle of a 3D surface.  A Fresnel shader will let you specify a specular color for parts of a surface directly facing the camera, and another specular color to be seen on parts of a surface that are perpendicular to the camera. In addition to the usual specular highlights and reflectivity, parameters such as the color or transparency can also be controlled by some Fresnel shaders.

The Fresnel Effect was first documented by the French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827), who advanced the wave theory of light through a study of how light was transmitted and propagated by different objects.
