## Pixel
The smallest unit in a computer image


In digital imaging, a pixel (abbreviated px), pel,[1] or picture element[2] is the smallest addressable element in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in a dot matrix display device. In most digital display devices, pixels are the smallest element that can be manipulated through software.


is the basic unit of programmable color on a computer display or in a computer image

Pixels are the smallest unit in a digital display. Up to millions of pixels make up an image or video on a device's screen. Each pixel comprises a subpixel that emits a red, green and blue (RGB) color, which displays at different intensities. The RGB color components make up the gamut of different colors that appear on a display or computer monitor.

When referencing the resolution of a display, numbers like 1920 x 1080 refer to the number of pixels.

The number of pixels is calculated by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel measurements. For example, HD has 1,920 horizontal pixels and 1,080 vertical pixels, which totals 2,073,600. It's normally shown as 1920 x 1080 or just as 1080p. The p stands for progressive scan. A 4K video resolution, for example, has four times more pixels than full high definition (HD), and 8K has 16 times more pixels than 1080p.


-   480p, which is standard definition, is 640 x 480 and is often used for small mobile devices;
-   720p, which is HD, is 1280 x 720;
-   1440p, which is 2550 x 1440 and considered quarter HD (QHD), is often used for PC gaming monitors; and
-   4K video resolution, which is ultra HD, is 3840 x 2160 pixels.
