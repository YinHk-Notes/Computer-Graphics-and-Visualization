## UV mapping

UV mapping is the 3D modeling process of **projecting a 3D model's surface to a 2D image for texture mapping**. 
The 3D object is **unwrapped** and the 2D texture is applied to it. 

The letters "U" and "V" denote the axes of the **2D texture**.

The letters U and V are used to define UV mapping because it signifies the axis of the 2D texture on the UV grid. X, Y, and Z are used for the axes on the 3D object. 

A **UV map** is the **flat surface** representation of a 3D model used to **wrap textures**. The process of creating a UV map is called **UV unwrapping**, which is done using 3D modeling software. 

Overall, **UV** mapping saves 3D artists time and makes texture mapping onto 3D objects easier and faster.
