## UV mapping

UV mapping is the 3D modeling process of **projecting a 3D model's surface to a 2D image for texture mapping**. 
The 3D object is **unwrapped** and the 2D texture is applied to it. 

The letters "U" and "V" denote the axes of the **2D texture**.

The letters U and V are used to define UV mapping because it signifies the axis of the 2D texture on the UV grid. X, Y, and Z are used for the axes on the 3D object. 

A **UV map** is the **flat surface** representation of a 3D model used to **wrap textures**. The process of creating a UV map is called **UV unwrapping**, which is done using 3D modeling software. 

Overall, **UV** mapping saves 3D artists time and makes texture mapping onto 3D objects easier and faster.


UV mapping is the 3D modeling process of projecting a 2D image onto a 3D model’s surface. The term “UV” refers to the bidimensional (2D) nature of the process: the letters “U” and “V” denote the axes of the 2D texture because “X”, “Y” and “Z” are already used to denote the axes of the 3D model.

The 3D model is unfolded at the seams and laid out flat on a 2D plan, not unlike the process used for pattern-making in sewing. Once the mapping is complete, the artist can produce a custom image based on the “pattern” and apply it to the 3D model.
