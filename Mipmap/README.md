## Mipmap

A **mipmap**(maximum intensity projection) is a sequence of textures, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the same image. The height and width of each image, or level, in the mipmap is a power of two smaller than the previous level. Mipmaps do not have to be square.

In computer graphics, mipmaps (also MIP maps) or pyramids[1][2][3] are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the previous.
