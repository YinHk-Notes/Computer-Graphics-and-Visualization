## Ray tracing

Ray tracing is a method of graphics rendering that simulates the physical behavior of light. 

In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.


Ray tracing is a lighting technique that brings an extra level of realism to games. It emulates the way light reflects and refracts in the real world,

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.
