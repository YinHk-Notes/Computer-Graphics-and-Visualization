## Shading


### Shader
In computer graphics, a **shader** is a **computer program** that calculates the **appropriate levels of light**, **darkness**, and **color** during the **rendering of a 3D scene** - a process known as **shading**.

Shaders have evolved to perform a variety of specialized functions in computer graphics special effects and video post-processing, as well as general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.


A program used to render different pixels. Shaders in games are used when detailing shadows, lighting, texture gradients, and more.


### What Can Shaders Do?
Sometimes games use simple shaders; other times, they may seem extremely complicated. The finished product of a shader program is often impressive, showing in-game assets or environments with proper lighting and shading applied to them.

Through their coding language, shaders transform dull and dreary environments that may have lacked a cohesive look to staggeringly beautiful works of art. You will see the difference if you turn your graphics settings all the way down in a visually impressive game. Without the shaders and other aspects, the game probably looks pretty flat.

Shaders bypass hard coding and allow for customizable, programmable shading in game design. Shaders add a certain sense of realism and artistic nuance to games that didnâ€™t exist decades ago. It causes breathtaking visual generation on the fly, in real-time.
