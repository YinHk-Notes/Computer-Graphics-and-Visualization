## Shading


### Shader
In computer graphics, a **shader** is a **computer program** that calculates the **appropriate levels of light**, **darkness**, and **color** during the **rendering of a 3D scene** - a process known as **shading**.

Shaders have evolved to perform a variety of specialized functions in computer graphics special effects and video post-processing, as well as general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.


A program used to **render different pixels**. Shaders in games are used when **detailing shadows**, **lighting**, **texture gradients, and more**.

電腦圖學領域中，著色器（英語：shader）是一種電腦程式，原本用於進行圖像的濃淡處理（計算圖像中的光照、亮度、顏色等），但近來，它也被用於完成很多不同領域的工作，比如處理CG特效、進行與濃淡處理無關的影片後期處理、甚至用於一些與電腦圖學無關的其它領域。

### What Can Shaders Do?
Sometimes games use simple shaders; other times, they may seem extremely complicated. The finished product of a shader program is often impressive, showing in-game assets or environments with proper lighting and shading applied to them.

Through their coding language, shaders transform dull and dreary environments that may have lacked a cohesive look to staggeringly beautiful works of art. You will see the difference if you turn your graphics settings all the way down in a visually impressive game. Without the shaders and other aspects, the game probably looks pretty flat.

Shaders bypass hard coding and allow for customizable, programmable shading in game design. Shaders add a certain sense of realism and artistic nuance to games that didn’t exist decades ago. It causes breathtaking visual generation on the fly, in real-time.
