## Shading language

A shading language is a **graphics programming language** adapted to programming shader effects (characterizing surfaces, volumes, and objects). Such language forms usually consist of special data types, like **"vector", "matrix", "color" and "normal"**.

Due to the variety of target markets for 3D computer graphics, different shading languages have been developed.
